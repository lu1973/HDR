# HDR
High Dynamic Range radiance maps

<p>A class for handling HDR imaging tasks, including sampling intensity,
estimating the response curve, computing radiance, and converting radiance
maps to HDR images.</p>
<p>I also add the reverse function to convert HDR to LDR for a given exposure.</p>
<p>This class implements methods based on the paper:
